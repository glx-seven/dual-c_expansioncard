# Dual-USB-c Expansioncard

This is a prototype of a dual USB-C expansioncard for the Framework-Laptop.
It is built around the 

There's an early real-world prototype I made that had some flaws, these are solved in the current revision but have not been verified in a new physical prototype.

In the .zip archive are all electronic design files included, this revision has not been tested since it evolved a little comparing to the initial prototype. The design was made in KiCAD 8.

The STEP-file is a prototype for an enclosure, the .txt-file mentions the needed additional hardware (heat inserts and spacers for PCB-installation).

There's quiet a long thread in the framework forums documenting the work (and the ones of some others) if you are interested in further details and reading. The process is starting around here: https://community.frame.work/t/dual-usb-c-expansion-card/2325/130?u=tbe

Here are some pictures of the prototype-PCB:
